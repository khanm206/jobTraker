1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector/querySelectorAll:-

-getElementById selects one element with a specific ID.
-getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a specific class. Returns an HTMLCollection.
-querySelector selects the first element that matches any CSS selector.
-querySelectorAll selects all elements that match a CSS selector and returns a NodeList.


2. How to create and insert a new element into the DOM:-
-Use document.createElement("tagName") to create a new element.
-Insert it into the page using appendChild().

3. What is Event Bubbling and how it works:-
-Event bubbling is when an event on an element propagates up through its parent elements.
-Example: Clicking a button inside a div triggers the button’s event first, then the div’s, then the body’s.

4. What is Event Delegation and why it is useful:-
-Event delegation is a technique where you add an event listener to a parent element to handle events on its child elements.
-It is useful because you don’t need to attach listeners to every child, and it works for dynamically added elements.

5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()
-preventDefault() stops the browser’s default action (like following a link or submitting a form).
-stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
